# Changelog

All notable changes to Deck Shelves will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Advanced filter groups** — filters can now be combined with AND/OR logic using nested filter groups, enabling complex queries like "installed AND (favorites OR played within 7 days)".
- New filter types: store tags, achievement count range, friends who own, update pending, and merge (combine multiple sources into one shelf).
- New sort options: release date, size on disk, Metacritic score, and review score.
- **TabMaster integration** — an "Import from TabMaster" button appears in the QAM when TabMaster is installed; tabs with filters become filter-based shelves, and built-in tabs become tab-based shelves.
- **UnifiDeck integration** — non-Steam apps managed by UnifiDeck (e.g. Epic, GOG, Amazon shortcuts) are automatically included in filter and tab shelves.
- Library tab selection now shows your actual library tabs (including custom tabs created by other plugins) instead of a static list.
- Non-Steam apps are now included in filter shelf results.

### Changed

- Filter shelf editor redesigned to support the new group-based filter UI.
- Tab source selection reflects real runtime tabs from the user's library.

### Fixed

- Delete shelf button no longer leaks destructive styling into Steam's system shutdown menu.
- Existing shelves backed by UUID tabs are automatically migrated to the correct filter-based source on load.
